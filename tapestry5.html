            <p>As a child growing up in a house overlooking the sea in St. Julian’s, she remembers the comfort of watching her father return home from work—waving at him from the galleria as he stepped off the bus near the old terminus. That feeling of security followed her into adulthood, later shaping her life on the Isle of Man, where she and her husband, a doctor, became part of a close-knit community. There, she recalls glamorous dinner dances in the island’s only hotel, wearing elegant evening dresses like her favourite midnight blue gown with silver rosebud details. These events brought joy and excitement, even as she navigated the cultural differences she faced as a European woman. Still, her sense of self and confidence, grounded in family and the strong bond with her husband, remained unshaken.</p>

            <p>As a child growing up in a house overlooking the sea in St. Julian’s, the interviewee recalls the quiet comfort of watching their father return home from work, waving from the galleria as they stepped off the bus near the old terminus. That small ritual, steeped in love and routine, instilled a lasting sense of safety and belonging. It was a feeling carried into adulthood, later finding echoes on the Isle of Man, where the interviewee and their spouse, a doctor, became part of a close-knit community, as the interviewee put it "There were more sheep than people". Life there took on a new rhythm, filled with moments of grace and celebration. The interviewee fondly remembers the glamorous dinner dances held in the island’s only hotel, nights illuminated by glimmering lights and the sound of a live band, which often played “Lady in Red,” a popular song at the time. Preparing for these balls was a joy in itself. They delighted in selecting or designing their outfits, even travelling to London to source beautiful fabrics for the occasion. Their favourite gown was a midnight blue dress adorned with delicate silver rosebuds, a piece that captured the elegance and excitement of those evenings. These events brought a sense of sophistication and belonging, even as the interviewee quietly navigated the cultural differences faced as a European living abroad. Yet through it all, their identity remained steady anchored in family, memory, and the enduring strength of their partnership.</p>

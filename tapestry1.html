            <p>The interviewee recounted a powerful and deeply emotional memory from their childhood, an event that marked the beginning of their family's unraveling. It unfolded during a Sunday lunch, triggered by a seemingly trivial detail: an egg wrapped in a piece of foil. Their father, gripped by paranoia, became convinced that the egg had been poisoned by his wife in an attempt to kill him. This irrational belief ignited a violent argument between the parents. At just ten years old, the interviewee was thrust into their fight, consumed by fear and an urgent instinct to protect their brother and mother. Their father's eruption of aggression and physical violence culminated in the interviewee being locked in a room, an act that remains etched in their memory. Now, more than a decade later, they reflect on that day with a conflicted blend of anger and acceptance. The experience forced them into premature maturity and left a profound impact on their sense of trust and understanding of relationships. Though years of therapy have helped them process much of the trauma, the memory endures vivid and unresolved, a painful chapter that continues to shape their emotional resilience.</p>

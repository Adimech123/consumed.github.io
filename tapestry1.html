            <p>About the Exhibition</p>
            <p>The interviewee shared a powerful and deeply emotional memory from their childhood, centered around the last major fight between their parents before their separation. They described a vivid scene that took place during a Sunday lunch, when a seemingly minor incident—an egg wrapped in foil—escalated into a violent altercation. At just ten years old, they recalled feelings of intense fear, chaos, and the instinct to protect their brother and mother. Their father’s aggressive behavior and the traumatic events that unfolded, including being locked in a room and witnessing physical violence, left a lasting impression. Now, a decade later, the interviewee reflects on the memory with a mix of anger and acceptance, recognizing how the experience forced them to mature quickly and shaped their view of relationships and trust. While they’ve worked through much of the trauma in therapy, the memory remains vivid and unresolved, symbolizing a difficult chapter that continues to influence their life and emotional resilience.</p>

            <p>Last summer, while working at a camp in Switzerland, the interviewee fulfilled a long-held dream by going paragliding. The journey to the launch site began with a walk up a steep, winding mountain road, each step heightening their anxiety as the reality of what lay ahead began to sink in. Their heart pounded with a mix of fear and anticipation. The cable car ride that followed offered a brief moment of awe and reflection: sweeping views of the valleys below, the distant peaks dusted with snow, and the dizzying drop beneath their feet. Though nervous, they found unexpected comfort in the calm, steady presence of the instructor, whose quiet confidence transcended the limits of language. What followed was a surge of emotion fear, exhilaration, and unfiltered joy. The sensation of the wind rushing past, the vast openness of the sky, and the breathtaking beauty of the alpine landscape all contributed to a moment they would never forget. It wasn’t just a thrill, it was a defining experience, one that reflected the interviewee’s adventurous spirit and resilience. Though the memory now feels somewhat distant, it still stirs pride and happiness, reinforcing a mindset rooted in courage: to embrace risk, and to focus not on what might go wrong, but on everything that could go right.</p>

            <p>During a holiday in New York, the interviewee narrowly escaped the 9/11 attacks while traveling with a group of thirty Maltese tourists. They had planned to visit the Twin Towers that morning, but a canceled flight the day before delayed their itinerary, an unexpected twist that ultimately saved their life. As they approached the city in a coach, chaos unfolded: traffic was gridlocked, sirens pierced the air, and panic gripped the streets. The interviewee watched in horror as they saw the aftermath of the attack on the towers, confronted with the terrifying realisation that they could have been one of those poor souls inside. Stranded in a city overwhelmed by fear and confusion, they navigated through crowds of dazed and grieving people before finally escaping by hiring a coach to drive the group overnight to Miami. The interviewee later reflected on how fortunate they were to have had the financial means to make that escape possible, an advantage not everyone had in those desperate hours that till today reminds them the importance of money. The experience was both surreal and traumatic, the air thick with dust, the sounds of sirens unrelenting, and the emotional devastation palpable. In the aftermath, they found themselves turning toward faith, feeling a deeper connection to God and the Holy Trinity, even as their trust in religious institutions began to fracture. The memory remains vivid: the smoke, the noise, the fear, and the overpowering sense of survival that continues to shape their perspective to this day.</p>

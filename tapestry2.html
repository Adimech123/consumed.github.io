            <p>During a holiday in New York, I narrowly escaped the 9/11 attacks with a group of 30 Maltese tourists. We were supposed to visit the Twin Towers that morning but were delayed due to a canceled flight the day before, which ultimately saved our lives. As we approached the city, chaos unfolded—streets were jammed, people were panicking, and sirens filled the air. We watched in horror as the towers were hit and later collapsed, realizing we could have been there. After being stranded and walking through crowds in shock and fear, we eventually escaped the city by hiring a coach to drive us to Miami overnight, since all flights were grounded. The experience was surreal and terrifying, filled with thick dust, sirens, and emotional devastation. It brought me closer to my faith in God and the Virgin Mary, although I lost trust in religious institutions. Even now, the memory is vivid—the sounds, the smoke, the fear, and the overwhelming sense of survival.</p>
